-- === ENABLED FEATURES ===
 * MPICommunication, Enables the MPI communication back-end.

   This enables the MPI communication back-end which is highly recommended on multi-node systems.
   See the documentation of the CMake module FindMPI to control its functionality.

   This feature can be enabled/disabled by setting the PRECICE_MPICommunication CMake option.

 * CBindings, Enables the native C bindings.

   preCICE provides native bindings for C, which are compiled into the library.
   This feature enables the compilation and installation of the bindings into the library.
   Note that we strongly recommend to compile with C bindings enabled for compatibility reasons.

   This feature can be enabled/disabled by setting the PRECICE_ENABLE_C CMake option.
  
 * FortranBindings, Enables the native Fortran bindings.

   preCICE provides native bindings for Fortran, which are compiled into the library.
   This feature enables the compilation and installation of the bindings into the library.
   Note that we strongly recommend to compile with Fortran bindings enabled for compatibility reasons.

   This feature can be enabled/disabled by setting the PRECICE_ENABLE_FORTRAN CMake option.
  

-- === DISABLED FEATURES ===
 * PETScMapping, Enables the PETSc-powered radial basic function mappings.

   This enables the PETSc-based variant of radial basis function mappings which can run in parallel,
   also across different compute nodes. This is highly recommended for large cases running in parallel.

   This feature can be enabled/disabled by setting the PRECICE_PETScMapping CMake option.
   Requires MPICommunication.
  
 * PythonActions, Enables the support for user-defined python actions.

   preCICE allows to manipulate coupling data at runtime using configurable actions.
   This feature enables the support for user-defined actions written in Python based on numpy.

   This feature can be enabled/disabled by setting the PRECICE_PythonActions CMake option.
